# How to tackle jQuery

### Release 0

At first I though this exercise seemed kind of silly, but now that I think about it, if I record what strategies were most effective, perhaps I can use them later when I'm researching other topics.

Here's how I plan on tackling jQuery:

* read a bit of background info on jQuery by googling it and finding whatever page looks most official and comprehensive, yet for beginners

* I know the challenge says to not justrely on Codeacademy, but I think I'll do a bit of it just to give myself hands-on experience

* Look up (and bookmark!) cheat sheets!

* Do the challenge over a few days so as to not cram all the information in at once, but allow it to sink in over a period of time

* Adjust my learning strategy based on how proficient I become; the more I learn about the topic, the better I'll probably be at researching it
