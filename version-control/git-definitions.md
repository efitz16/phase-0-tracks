# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a feature of Git technology that allows you to not only make changes to files, but also saves earlier changes so that you can review them or revert them, effectively creating backups of your files. Verson control also allows you to merge revisions made by a variety of people on one file or program. Obviously, this is useful for a variety of reasons; version control protects code, allows for collaboration, and enables you to fix mistakes made in the past.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch acts largely as a copy of a project that can be worked on and changed while the main version of the project is preserved in a master branch. The different versions can later be merged. [source](https://devbootcamp.instructure.com/courses/35/assignments/3508?module_item_id=18728)

Branches can be switched between, allowing you to work on and test different features without disrupting the original file. [source](https://devbootcamp.instructure.com/courses/35/assignments/3508?module_item_id=18728)

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a save point in Git. It has a unique ID, a message about what was done, an author, and a time stamp. Commits need to be done manually, i.e. entered on your terminal's command line. A good commit message is specific about what kind of changes were made. [source](https://devbootcamp.instructure.com/courses/35/assignments/3507?module_item_id=18727)

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict arises when Git is unable to merge multiple changes made to a file, usually when merging two branches or attempting to revoke a stash. [source](http://githubtraining.com/fix-merge-conflict-git-using-sourcetree/)
