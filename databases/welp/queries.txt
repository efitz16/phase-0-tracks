You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

> SELECT * FROM reviews, users, buisnesses WHERE reviews.user_id = users.id AND reviews.business_id = buisnesses.id;

1|3|Great place!|3|3|3|Steven Wonder|3|Lotus Yoga
2|4|Fast car service!|2|1|1|Bradford Pitt|2|Amir's Towing
3|1|Ruined my wedding!|1|2|2|Mandy Kaling|1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chaple
 
There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.
 
> SELECT buisnesses.name, users.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM users, buisnesses JOIN reviews ON reviews.user_id = users.id AND reviews.business_id = buisnesses.id;

How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business?

> SELECT * FROM users, buisnesses JOIN reviews ON reviews.user_id = users.id AND reviews.business_id = buisnesses.id WHERE business_id=3;
